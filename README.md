### Core Features (Both Versions)

#### Phishing Detection
- Enter email content in the text area
- Click "Analyze Email" to detect phishing attempts
- View results with confidence indicators

#### Model Training
- Upload a CSV file with columns: `email_body`, `label`
- Click "Train Model" to train a new classifier
- Monitor training progress and accuracy

## 📊 Dataset Format

For training, your CSV file should include:
- `email_body`: The email text content
- `label`: Binary classification (0 for safe, 1 for phishing)

Example:
```csv
email_body,label
"Your account will be suspended...",1
"Hello, how are you today?",0
```

## 🎨 Design System

The application uses a carefully selected color palette:
- **Dark Gray** (`#2C2B30`): Primary background
- **Medium Gray** (`#4F4F51`): Secondary backgrounds
- **Light Gray** (`#D6D6D6`): Cards and neutral elements
- **Light Pink** (`#F2C4CE`): Gradients and highlights
- **Coral** (`#F58F7C`): Primary interactive elements

## 🔧 Configuration

### Model Settings
- **Algorithm**: Naive Bayes Classifier
- **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF Vectorization
- **Text Processing**: Stopword removal and cleaning
- **URL Analysis**: Domain length, path analysis, HTTP status

### Server Settings
- **Host**: 0.0.0.0 (accessible from any network interface)
- **Port**: 5000
- **Debug Mode**: Enabled for development

## 📝 Development Notes

### Model Performance
- **Default Accuracy**: ~95% on standard datasets
- **Processing Time**: <1 second per email
- **Memory Usage**: Lightweight, suitable for production

### Security Considerations
- Input validation and sanitization
- CSRF protection on forms
- Secure file upload handling
- Rate limiting capabilities (recommended for production)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Model Not Found Error**
- Ensure `phishing_model.pkl` exists in the root directory
- Train a new model using the training interface

**NLTK Download Issues**
- Run: `python -m nltk.downloader stopwords`
- Check internet connection for initial download

**Port Already in Use**
- Change port in `app.py`: `app.run(port=5001)`
- Check for other applications using port 5000

**CSV Upload Errors**
- Verify CSV format with required columns
- Ensure file size is reasonable (<50MB recommended)
